### DESIGNED FOR VIDEO LABELING AT SCALE
# Label video, not just bunch of images
Apart from many other labeling software, Supervisely lets you work with your video files without cropping them into images first.

To archive this, we designed a video player, capable of handling hours-long videos, yet precisely switching between individual frames right in your web browser.

## 24 FPS × 60 SECS × 60 MINS = 86,400 FRAMES IN 1H

A single one-hour video contains about a hundred thousand frames. Cutting such a video into individual images has countless disadvantages, comparing to our approach



## Timeline panel keeps you focused on labeling, not roaming around frames

It’s easy to get frustrated with thousands of frames and objects labeled.

Video timeline panel provides overall structure, answers questions like what is already labeled and simplifies editing tag segments and tracked objects.

### DESIGNED FOR TRACKING
# Object tracking at scale
Locate one or multiple objects of interest in each frame of your videos with built-in object tracking algorithms. Supervisely provides automated tools to assign a unique ID to each tracked object and produce accurate bounding boxes or even instance segmentation masks.


## Top tracking AI: SOT & MOT

Choose between carefully picked state-of-the-art trackers or integrate your own algorithm without any special knowledge.
